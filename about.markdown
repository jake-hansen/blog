Hi, I'm Jake Hansen. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity.

I like learning about networking, programming techniques, secure application design, and web security. Sometimes I work on some random personal projects just to learn a new framwork or language better. When I'm working on something cool or useful I'll try to share it here.
